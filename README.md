# 👋 Hi, I’m Adam

### 🧑🏻‍💻 I’m good with
* Full stack development, from frontend to backend and everywhere inbetween
* UX Design
* Sofware Architecture
* Agile/Scrum

### 💡 I Have particular interests in
* Not just good, but great UI's - Backends make the application, and Frontends make the application **usable**
* Automation - there's something so satisfying with automating a mundane task with code, I'm ~~lazy~~ effecient
* Collaborating with others - team wins are big in my book
* Monitoring and Observability - visualizing application behavior through logs and automating alerts of any issues

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
* Go - I've found it super useful for CLI and Infra type tasks
* Algorithms - Always practicing to ace those technical interviews
* NoSQL - Haven't had many opprotunities to work with NoSQL stores, but enjoy them when I do

### 🗂 I’m currently working on some projects
  #### Adamdavis.me
  A personal site for myself. I took my resume and wanted to provide a more interactive story. It's in its early stages, but I'm proud of having something polished to demo and is both web and mobile friendly. 
  
  #### Squadly
  A chatting app using a full stack of modern technologies: Angular, NestJS, Websockets, Nx monorepo, docker, redis... This is teaching me a lot and is a good showcase for my full stack skill set. Looking to host it for my friends and provide some better chatting experience and UI that popular apps lack
