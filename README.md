## 👋 Hi, I’m Adam


## 🧑🏻‍💻 I’m good with
* Full stack development, from frontend to backend and everywhere inbetween
* UX Design
* Sofware Architecture
* Agile/Scrum

## I Have particular interests in
* Not just good, but great UI's - Backends make the application, and Frontends make the application **usable**
* Monitoring and Observability - visualizing application behavior through logs and automating alerts of any issues

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
* Go - I've found it super useful for CLI and Infra type tasks
* Algorithms - Always practicing to ace those technical interviews
* NoSQL - Haven't had many opprotunities to work with NoSQL stores, but enjoy them when I do

##  I’m currently working on some projects to 
  1) pratice 
  2) learn new technologies outside of work
  3) showcase myself!

  A chatting app using a full stack of modern technologies: Angular, NestJS, Websockets, Nx monorepo, docker, redis... This is teaching me a lot and is a good showcase for my full stack skill set. Looking to host it for my friends and provide some better chatting experience and UI that popular apps lack
